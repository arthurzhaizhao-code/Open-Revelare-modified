    // the same transform the pixels do.
    //
    // Only the incremental operation is applied, not the whole orientation — for the FLIPS that
    // is unconditionally sound (they are applied last, so toggling one mirrors the displayed
    // frame and nothing else). For a QUARTER TURN it holds only when the mirrors compose to a
    // rotation, i.e. zero or two of them: a single mirror CONJUGATES the turn into its inverse,
    // because Geometry.ApplyOrientation runs the turns FIRST and the flips after.
