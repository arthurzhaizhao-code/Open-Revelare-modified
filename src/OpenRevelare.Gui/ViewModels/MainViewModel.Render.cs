    //
    // The debounce is a "wait for quiet" rule, and a slider drag is never quiet: every move
    // cancelled the pending render and started the 50 ms wait again, so the picture did not move
    // at all until the user stopped — the control was live but the image was not following it.
    //
    // A drag therefore switches strategy entirely, the way the source does
    // (main_window.py::_on_interaction_started):
    //
    //   • No debounce. Every move renders.
    //   • Half the preview's long edge, i.e. a quarter of the pixels. The heavy density inversion
    //     re-runs on every move because FilmBase/WB edits invalidate everything upstream of it.
    //   • The downsampled source is computed ONCE per drag and reused. It cannot change mid-drag
    //     (the frame, its decode and the photometric chain are all fixed), and re-deriving it per
    //     move costs more than the render it feeds.
    //   • SYNCHRONOUSLY, on the UI thread. Handing each move to a worker means the moves that
    //     arrive while one is running are dropped, which is what makes a preview lurch instead of
    //     track; running inline lets the pointer input coalesce naturally against the work, so
    //     every frame that is computed is a frame that is shown.
    //
    // Release restores full resolution with one immediate, un-debounced pass.
