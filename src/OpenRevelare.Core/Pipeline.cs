        // NO BLACK-POINT NORMALISATION. Stage 1 used to end by mapping the sampled film base to
        // linear zero — (v - floor)/(1 - floor) — so that the base came out pure black. That was
        // Stage 1 deciding, on the display rendering's behalf, that a calibrated film base is
        // black. In the Cineon workflow it is not: the base lands on code 95, which reads as a
        // GREY, and it only becomes black when a display transform takes it there. Normalising
        // here forced the two exits to disagree — pass-through rendered the base at 0 while a
        // print-film cube rendered code 95 as its own toe — and the only lever a user had to
        // reconcile them was D_min, which is calibration, not rendering.
        //
        // So Stage 1 now stops at 10^D_adj and both exits go through the same Cineon encoding.
