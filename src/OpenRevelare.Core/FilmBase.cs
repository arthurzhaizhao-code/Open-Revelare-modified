        // maximum. The frames' own endpoints were consistent to within 10%; the pooled one was
        // further from any of them than they were from each other.
        //
        // Taking ONE frame keeps the triplet co-sited all the way through: it is one physical
        // highlight, on one piece of film, measured under one exposure. That is the same choice
        // <see cref="AutoWbHighFromRoll"/> makes for the same quantity, and it is what makes the
        // two agree. <paramref name="rollPercentile"/> is retained for API compatibility but no
        // longer selects between frames.
        //
        // WHICH frame is a second question, and "the densest" is the wrong answer to it on its
        // own. Density decides how DEEP the endpoint sits; the ratios between the three channels
        // decide the roll's HIGHLIGHT COLOUR — and those ratios are then applied to every frame,
        // because the endpoints are per-channel divisors. A single frame whose brightest subject
        // is strongly coloured (a sunset, a neon sign, a red wall) can top the roll on total
        // density while its ratios describe that subject rather than the film. Picking it hands
        // its cast to the whole roll, and no Stage-2 control can take it back out.
        //
        // So the pick is by quality-weighted log-chroma CONSENSUS between frames — neither depth
        // nor a fitted trend is allowed to decide.
        //
        // NOTE these triples are PRE-RESCALE: the no-clip lift below is applied to the winner
        // only. The lift is one factor on all three channels, so it cannot change any frame's
        // RATIOS — the colour comparison is unaffected — but it does change totals, so a frame's
        // depth here is not the same number a single-frame solve reports for it.
        //
        // AND THEY ARE RELATIVE TO <paramref name="tBase"/>. Every ratio argument in this method
        // — the co-siting, the pick, the lift preserving colour — is only true of densities
        // measured against the FILM BASE, because the inversion consumes the SPAN
        // dMax_c − dMin_c (DensityEndpoints.FromMeasured), and the colour balance is the ratio
        // between the three spans. Called with a neutral 1,1,1 the triples are absolute, each
        // channel carries its own dMin, and two things go wrong at once: the absolute ratio
        // (dMin_R + s_R)/(dMin_G + s_G) drifts toward the base's own colour as the highlight
        // gets shallower, which is a trend that is NOT in the spans; and lifting the winner by k
        // turns its span into k·s + (k−1)·dMin — a per-channel offset in the base's colour, so
        // the "colour-preserving" lift is a cast in the domain that matters. Measured on 诺日士1089
        // (12 frames, no board): the absolute pick landed on 003a and a 1.549× lift moved its span
        // R/G from 0.866 to 0.767 against 0.905 on a confirmed-neutral frame, and the whole roll
        // came out red. The same numbers measured against the base pick a frame in the neutral

        // instead of through the triple, which is the same failure wearing a different hat.
        //
        // Measured on the 除碳5219 roll (32 frames, Fuji): DSCF5657 set all three channels of the
        // pool on its own and lifted the chosen triple 1.197×, from DSCF5654's measured
        // [1.323, 1.622, 2.274] to [1.584, 1.942, 2.722]. Every ordinary frame on that roll then
        // rendered against an endpoint ~20% above its own highlight — frame DSCF5635's brightest
        // tone reached only 0.82/0.81/0.77 of the divisor it was applied to, so the whole strip
        // came out flat and dark with 17.6% of its highlight range unreachable. Dropping that one
        // frame moved the roll to [1.344, 1.648, 2.310] and the lift to 1.016. The percentile
        // reaches that answer WITHOUT having to know which frame to drop.
        //
        // The percentile is high enough that ordinary frame-to-frame spread still lifts the
        // endpoint — clipping the roll's genuine highlights is the failure this rescale exists to
        // prevent, and it stays prevented for every frame at or below the percentile. What it
        // gives up is absolute protection for the extreme tail: a lone frame above it can clip.

        // endpoint is neither: it is a per-channel divisor applied to all 32 frames at once.
        //
        // THE COST, STATED PLAINLY: 整卷 no longer equals 单张 on any one frame. Those two now

        // fit the frames in it — so a roll whose frames differ in depth will not reproduce its

        // correct colour, taken because the invariant was costing the roll its highlight balance:
        // ranking on depth handed an expired Superia 200 roll to its most off-colour frame.

    /// WHY CONSENSUS. The frames of a roll are repeated measurements of one film's highlight only
    /// where the brightest subject was actually neutral — a white wall, a cloud, a blown sky. Those
    /// frames all report the same ratios, to within grain, and there are typically several of
    /// them. A frame whose brightest subject was coloured (a sunset, a lamp, a red wall) reports
    /// that subject, and no two such frames report the same thing. So the film's colour is where
    /// the triples PILE UP, and a subject's colour is wherever one triple sits on its own. Ranking
    /// each frame by its distance to its nearest few neighbours finds the pile without knowing
    /// any frame's content. Measured on 诺日士1089 (12 frames): five well-exposed frames sit within
    /// ±1.5% of each other in R/G and ±2.5% in B/G, the seven shallow ones scatter over 17% and
    /// 40%, and the three tightest frames are the ones a person had picked as reference.

    /// WHY NOT DEPTH. A frame whose highlight is off-neutral reads as denser, since its strong
    /// channel inflates the total; whichever frame depth favours is systematically the one least
    /// representative in colour. Measured on an expired Superia 200 roll, the deepest frame was
    /// also the worst colour match and took the roll with it.

    /// WHY NOT THE MEDIAN. The median of the ratios assumes the frames scatter about the film's
    /// colour, so an asymmetric spread of coloured subjects pulls it off the cluster; and ranking
